VirusHunter

You are a white blood cell drifting through the blood stream. But you are on a mission.  
A nasty virus infiltrated the system and it is your job to collect it and help your human get better.  
Make sure to not touch the red blood cells, they will try to stop you on your mission.  
Be patient and vigilant.  
Good luck!
